# Active Task
**Phase:** 01-cinematic-upgrade
**Step:** 4 (The Glass Lens - Post Processing)

## Current Context
We have a 3D Bent Title and restored Cymatics. Now we need the "Glass Lens" to make it feel like a physical camera recording.

## Todo
- [x] Create `shaders/title/shimmerTitle.ts`.
- [x] Update `CinematicIntro` with 3D Mesh and Custom Shader.
- [ ] Create `components/effects/CinematicLens.tsx`.
- [ ] Implement `ChromaticAberration` shader (RGB Split + Barrel Distortion).
- [ ] Hook up `useMicAudio` bass to the distortion strength.
