# Project: Frequency Design Lab (V11)

## Vision
To create a "world-class" cinematic web experience that feels like **Tactile Materialism**. It should transcend typical web design (DOM elements) and feel like a physical simulation of light, fluid, and frequency.

## Aesthetics
- **Tactile Materialism:** Sub-pixel precision, physical light interaction.
- **Deep Space / Bioluminescence:** Indigo, Deep Blue, not bright "tech" Cyan.
- **Cinematic:** Anamorphic lens effects, grain, chromatic aberration.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16
- React Three Fiber (R3F)
- GLSL Shaders (GPGPU, Custom Materials)
- Tailwind CSS
